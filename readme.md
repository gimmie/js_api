# Sample Gimmie JavaScript App

Just a demonstration of how the js api is used.

WARNING: Do not use this on a public site, it has key/secret in plaintext and is not appropriate for browser usage.

## Setup

To run the website use any generic service or use ruby/rack via running `rackup` after they're installed.

Edit the index.html file to include your key, secret, and apiHostname.

Choose an event name that exists in your system and POST an event to ensure it's working.

## Usage

Adjust field values and edit index.html to play around with different settings.

## Dependencies

See the index.html file for javascript dependencies.

## Installing the JavaScript API elsewhere

Ensure you have the proper dependencies set up and then simply copy the gimmie.js file.
